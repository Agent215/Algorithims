# Random Algorithims 
i have a bunch of random algorithims laying around various places. thought i would throw them up here.

## files included
 - mario.c  // algo made to solve a google games event question
 - fibDynamic.cpp // compute nth fibonacci number in polynomial time using dynamic programing. 
 - bitwise.c      // a program to perform bitwise operations on two unsigned integers 
 - compountintrest.py // simple I/O script to calculate compound interest, written in python
